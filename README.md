        Prominent Components:

        Search Bar:
        - Uses the "onChange()" function to operate
        - Works on every page on which it is present

        Charts:
        - Made through Chart.js
        - Web-responsive
        - True data 
        - Does NOT update actively update chart in this state of the build

        Seperation of Pages:
        - There is basically a duplicate of every page to ensure a user must go through the "registration" system, so a user from any point after the log in process cannot go back to any pages beforehand convetionally, it can only be done using the back arrow and 
        editing the url

        Fake Login System:
        - The log in and sign up systems are FAKE, they do not function as though you would think, however, they function as they are designed
        - There is no storing of value with this build, so it accepts any values to get to the memberHome.html and beyond
        - One is required to go through the log in or sign up system, unless the user already knows the files and urls
